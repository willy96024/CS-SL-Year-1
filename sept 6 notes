Advantages: 
Lower initial costs, likely faster implementation
Maintenance and updates by software manufacturer
No staff needed to maintain the system 
Software manufacturer likely provides more support
On-site natural disasters do not put data at risk 

Disadvantages: 
continued subscription fees may ultimately be more expensive than On-premises software or custom designed software for large companies
Potential data-risk from software manufacturer
Potential differing time zones, maintenance and support may not be at convenient times
Specialized or unusual needs of a specific client may not be a priority of the software manufacturer
Because host is not the user itself, user feedback is harder to get
System change may be required sooner than ideal if the service is discontinued, the company seeks new functionality that the manufacturer is not interested in adding, or the manufacturer goes out of business")
