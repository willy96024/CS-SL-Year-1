Honestly I think I was really close to getting them all right, I accidentally just mismatched 1 with 3, but to be honest, for my first time deciding I think I did really good, so I'm actually pretty proud of that. I must've missed something when grading 3 which made me give it to 1 so that was probably just my bad. I agree with all of them. I can't really disagree since I'm not a IB grader and plus I got almost all of them correct so I think all the evaluation was pretty fair since wherever they pointed out things missing and such it wasn't hard to spot. Overall I think all the people did good jobs on their IA's they could've just paid attention to a few areas more than others. My opinions are pretty much the same as the grader's.
