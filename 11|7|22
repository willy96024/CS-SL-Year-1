Do you think any of today's content would be useful for your IA would be beneficial? 
Do you plan to any of them for your IA?

Actually I think wireframes and mockups will be really useful to me. I've never heard of these things before and I think they'll be less time consuming than prototypes so I think that using these techniques to work on my IA will prove invaluable to being effective and concise with my work. Paper prototypes sound cool too so maybe that's something I could look at.
