UI(In my own words): its the interface which the product user will see(this includes navigation, visuals, etc.). It's kind of like the structure of your product. I can't really think of the wods

some prorams I could possibly make are calculators for certain types of math problems(algebra likely). Although this has already been done I feel like making one for myself would be a cool experience and could be shared to my brother in case he ever needs to check his answers and also "playtest" my program.

Another program I could make could be a miny game that works like a "yes or no" program. If series of yes's or no's are made they receive their corresponding responses. It's difficult to put into words but I've seen it been done before in tiktoks and such so I think it'd be cool to make for some of my friends(likely girl ones since I don't think this would appeal much to my guy friendss).
