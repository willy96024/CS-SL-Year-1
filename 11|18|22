Find a source that discusses what the future may look like. 
Summarize it.

Source: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/atlantic-council-strategy-paper-series/welcome-to-2030-three-visions-of-what-the-world-could-look-like-in-ten-years/c
The source talks about different outcomes dependent on certain things such as "European and Asian countries don't go along with splitting up the world again" which can have various effects. The source doesn't necessarily target technological advancements or anything like that, but more targets political or geological aspects. I thought it was a really interesting article since it writes about things which I haven't thought about.




What are your thoughts about Elon Musk and his ideas for Mars?

I think Elon Musk's idea is nice and all, but I wonder how the "labour" thing will work out. I feel skeptical about it. I'll try to keep myself posted for his progress on this idea, but I'm not sure if I completely am inclined towards the idea.



We know unemployment is an issue. We know lack of wage growth vs inflation is an issue. If you look into discouraged workers, underpaid workers, overqualified workers, and so on and so on, you'll also see that the problem is much bigger than just the official unemployment number and inflation.                            What's the solution?
Should we have shorter work weeks so more could be employed? Of course, more people employed means more expenses for the companies, so maybe that can't be the answer...
Should we have a UBI?
What are your thoughts? 

I think UBI is a really cool idea. The government can assist those in need at a fixed monthly rate or whatever and help keep everyone living at relatively decent conditions, or at least assist people if their jobs aren't paying enough.
