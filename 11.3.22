wireframe - visual representation of your user interface
4 functions: communicate four things: 1. the structure of your navigation and information architecture 2. the layout including page hierarchy and the placement of elements on the screen 2. the content wireframes give content light as an idea of how their content will be placed within the design 3 and the functionality. wireframes can describe how your product will work and how it interacts for the people using it.
come in handy in many situations. created at varying levels of fidelity(what makes them powerful)

low fidelity end: hand drawn sketch
sketches are good to flesh out ideas. fast to create and quick to iterate. 

traditional wireframe. balsamic omnigraffle illustrator and UX pin are some of the more known wireframes. help communicate your idea to your team your clients and your stakeholders. useful to explain your product and what you're building

high fidelity on the spectrum: clickable prortotype that lets you desgin interactions. clickable prototypes are the way to go when conducting usability testing. You could use axure keynote or even create wireframes into the browser using HTML. 



wireframe in my own words: a strategy that helps one get a look at what their UI will look like and work.

gestalt principles in my paper prototype: I think symmetry was a strong principle found in my prototype as well as similarity. others may include figure ground and proximity

What aspects of Usability & Accessibility will be important for your product?  
Error will be super important so that there's no bugs in my product and everything works in the first place
Complexity/Simplicity will also be important since it's important that the process of our product won't be to complicated or time consuming for our users.
Finally I think satisfaction will also be important, since if our users don't like our product then well our product won't make money, so changes will need to be made. 
I think the other aspects of U&A will all be important in one way or another

Are there specific areas you feel your design needs to excels in? 
describe and explain.
Complexity/Simplicity. Since we want to renovate a current product to be better, we have to make sure it stays how it is in terms of complexity, but its also important that we can bring our changes too at the same time.

 Are there specific areas you feel your design could have usability or accessibility issues? 
describe and explain.
I'm not sure to be honest, but
