I used my 2nd source: https://www.getsmarter.com/blog/career-advice/crowdsourcing-using-disruptive-technology-to-solve-challenging-problems/

The resource highlights crowdsourcing as a way to solve challenging problems. It also provided an example of how Andrew McAfee used it to solve a problem he faced. He specifically talked about the impact of crowdsourcing and how it aided him in solving his problem(which means he gave credit to crowdsourcing). It showed me how crowdsourcing works in the real-world(helped me understand it more)
