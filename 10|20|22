Do you feel any of the authentication method types are specifically stronger or weaker than the others?
I think biometric authentication is very strong as an authentication method, especially in today's time where everyone uses phones and most people use these things instead of a password because they're much faster and more accomoding than typing a whole phrase or whatever. I believe that 2FA is a lot less useful than the rest of most authentication methods because it's more of a hassle than actually useful in my opinion, but that might be just me.
Do you use MFA/2FA already? Do you plan on using it in the future?
Yes, my phone has a fingerprint scanner instead of a password and I use 2FA on some platforms
What are your thoughts on the use of biometrics?
I think it's very handy and favor this over inputting a password to get into my phone and other such things. Plus it could possibly be safer? that may be debatable however
Should we keep or get rid of Biometrics? Should there be limitations on them? 
I think we should keep Biometrics unless something more useful or efficient arises. I don't think there's any downside to biometrics, at least those such as fingerprints and face scans, but making them mandatory should be a limit to them that should be into place. I also believe that things like chips in the skin or something like that to like you put in your body is too far.
