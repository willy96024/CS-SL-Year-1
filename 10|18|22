I decided to read source 1 (How MIT's new biological 'computer' works, and what it could do in the future
Summary:
The article talks about something like turning cells into steps towards turning cells into mini computers(storing information). According to the source cells have seen to be possible powerful computing units all on their own, additionally because of their small size millions can fit into the tiniest spaces. Research done by MIT and facts about cells are provided throughout the article. "In general, cells are smply different than computers." The article does state that biotechnology is a ways off from getting to use cells as computers, but because of cells complexity and difference from computers, their full capabilities aren't known and more research has to be done. For the most part, the article talks about fancy scientific stuff that I have no idea about(obviously biology related)
