Are any of interest to you? Which?
Adobe Max Creativity Conference and Unity Unite 2022

Part 2:
Which criteria sounds the most concerning to you? Why?
I think planning is the hardest part because you have to come up with everything in this section, the rest of the criteria depends on this and it's like the base of everything so I think this is the most important and concerning

Which criteria sounds the least concerning to you? Why?
Evaluating will definitely be the easiest since it's at the end of everything so I think this'll be my least concerning criteria. Either this or functionality.

Part 3:
Come up with four possible clients, and a potential thing you could create for each of them? 
1. An art teacher asks a computer science student to develop a program which can randomly generate color images(patterns, stripes, etc.) in order to test their students recognition of color shades(such as crimson red, salmon pink, etc.)
2. A family member(ex: mom or dad) asks student to develop a website to help promote their side-business
3. The student wants to polish his website in order to make it more appealing visually. The student needs to learn javascript so that he can apply it to his site and make it better
4. A friend needs a program which can help determine whether or not he will end up with an A average for the semester(a grade calculator basically).
